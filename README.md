A summary of the project goals- Get a background, and other images for the game, creating pseudocode for the game, getting images to show up on background, getting chacratcer to move, setting boundaries for character, having the game restart when character gets hit by block, and setting up a homescreen. 
Instructions the player may need- Cross the road without getting hit by the redblocks. 
Citations for any external resources you used- The external resources I used were the slides provided, and a little bit of help from my older brother. 
What did you learn?- I learned a lot of building a game engine and using the skills I have alreayd learned to build somewhat of a game. 
Where did you get stuck?- I got stuck on getting the frog to show up as the character, and having the frog being able to jump. Also, getting an actual float image to be on the screen for the frog to jump on and move. 
What would you like to improve?- Similar to the question of where I got stuck. I would like to improve the whole game by adding actaul frogger images, and having the frog be able to jump around. 
How would you do things differently next time?- Next time, I would hope to make the game a little bit more fun for the user, maybe adding a timer, and an actaul finish line. 
How far did you stray from the game design document?- Not too far, I believe the game design document really helped me in creating this game. 
How did you stay on track?- The reason I stayed on track was because I enjoyed this type of project. It really didn't seem like "homework", and that was the fun part about this project that I was able to create an actaul game.
